# BookLook
This website has been refactored from using RESTful API methods to add, change, and delete data with Mongoose 
to using GraphQL query methods with the Apollo server and client. This is a full-stack application using React for the user interface, MongoDB as a database, Apollo
to query and change items in the database, and Node.js for the backend server.
